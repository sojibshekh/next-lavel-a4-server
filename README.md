## 🏗️ About The Project

A RESTful backend API for managing a library:
- **Book management**: create, retrieve, update, delete, and filter books.
- **Borrowing logic**: borrow books with real-time availability and copy-tracking.
- **Aggregation summary**: lists total borrowed copies per book.
- Fully typed with **TypeScript**, built on **Express**, and uses **MongoDB + Mongoose**.
